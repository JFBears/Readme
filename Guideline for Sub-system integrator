In general, the preferred workflow is:

1,Use git fetch to update your remote reference and create a branch from master, check it out, do your work
2,Test and commit your changes
3,Rebase your branch to master 
4,Checkout master, make sure it's up-to-date with upstream changes
5,Merge your branch into master
6,Test again (and again)
7,Create annotated tag on major release
8,Push your local copy of master up to the remote repository master (origin/master)
9,Push your tag to the remote repository master if applicable 
10,Delete your branch (and remotely, too, if you published it)


NEVER force a push
If you find yourself in a situation where your changes can't be pushed upstream, something is wrong. Contact system integrator for help tracking down the problem.

NEVER rebase a branch that you pushed, or that you pulled from another person
Rebasing published branches can lead to duplicate commits in the shared repository.
